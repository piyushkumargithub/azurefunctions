This repository contains Azure Functions implemented using Python module v2. It's designed to be run locally with full simulation of Azure resources using tools like Azurite and Azure Storage Explorer.

## ðŸ›  Prerequisites

### 1. Install Azure Core Tools
To run Azure Functions locally, [install Azure Core Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local).

> **Note:** A system restart may be required after installation on Windows.

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```

Once activated, the environment name will appear on the left side of your command prompt.

### 3. Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸš€ Running the Function App

Start the app locally using:

```bash
func start
```

Once running, you can hit the respective endpoints to test your functions.

## ðŸ§ª Simulating Azure Storage

Use **Azurite** to simulate Azure Storage accounts locally.

- [Install Azurite](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite)
- Or simply:

```bash
npm install -g azurite
azurite
```

## ðŸ—‚ Accessing Storage Locally

Download [Azure Storage Explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-explorer/vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer) to interact with your storage accounts locally.

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

Create a `local.settings.json` file in the root of your Function directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "python",
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true"
  }
}
```
